/// for rewriting the way camera's are checked in and viewed


////  cams ////
    //on boot//
    have cams connect to websocket homeserver
    send socket message containing unit id and stream url   

    //remote streaming //
        /v2 (future rewrite) for sending stream directly from camera/
    when stream request is sent from remote server, relay from homeserver to camera
    set remote viewing to true on both cam and homeserver
    from cam:
        when remote viewing is set to true
        during frame reading (below psuedocode):
        encode frame with base64, send from cam to homeserver via socket
        relay from homeserver to remote server via remote socket
        continue frame reading

        on signal to close stream (see part of Closing remote viewing failsafe below):
            set remote viewing to false
        
        continue


    Closing remote viewing failsafe:
        django channels on socket disconnect:
            if user disconnects without closing the stream,
            send socket message to homeserver to close all streams
            relay socket messages from homeserver to all units
